You need help with your project, or when you need to talk. I'll always try my best to be avalaible and give you a solution.


##### A funny story about me

When I was 8 or 9 years old, my big brother and my big sister went in a semi fight (you know, those kind of fight between siblings where they are laughing). My brother went in the office to pick something while my sister ran in the living room and sat between my mom and me. She leaned over to protect herself, and I leaned backward to check what was happening.
That's when I saw a big fluorescent marker flying in my direction, hitting me on my eyebrow.
What you need to know is that it was a Sunday, during the Communions in May. We called the doctor on call who came as drunk as a sailor. He proposed to stitch me up even so he couldn't see straight. It's my father who pointed that we could use "strips", to which the doctor responded with "oh, that's actually a good idea ! Let's dot that".

###### TL;DR

The story where a drunk doctor on call wanted to stitch me up.
